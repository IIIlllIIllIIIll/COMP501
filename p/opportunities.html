            <p>
                Open-source software creates many opportunities for developing countries, such as lowering costs and
                improving access; Free software is not necessarily free of charge; it can be sold. However, buyers can
                resell or distribute it for free, leading to a likely price of zero. While the software itself might be
                free, there are minimal costs for distribution, such as CDs, printed manuals, or internet communication.
                These costs are incurred only once, and the marginal cost of redistributing the software is zero, after
                choosing free software for its low cost, other benefits become clear, such as the ability to adapt it to
                local needs. Unlike proprietary software companies, which are typically global and concentrated in a few
                regions, free software can be tailored more easily to specific local requirements.

            <p>
                (THE OPPORTUNITIES OF FREE/LIBRE/OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DRAFT, n.d.) Global
                companies focus on investments with global returns and may neglect local needs due to the natural
                monopolies created by network effects and proprietary standards. The 2002 FLOSS study revealed that the
                primary motivation for developers to engage in open-source communities is to learn new skills for free.
                These skills, valuable for job opportunities and sustaining small businesses, go beyond just using free
                software. They include programming, understanding copyright law and licenses, and teamwork and team
                management. Managing large, dispersed teams in open-source projects requires more intensive and subtle
                coordination than managing smaller, co-located teams in a typical software company.
