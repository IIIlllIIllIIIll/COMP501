                <p>
                    Developers have the most control over the software, thus their actions could greatly improve this
                    situation and reduce risks. Some choices including:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Develop and use advanced static code analysis
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increase test coverage
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accepting certain preventive patches
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Raising developers' risk awareness
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standardize code merge procedure, and require more developers to review before the merge
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-2">(Lins et al., 2024)</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    One way to mitigate the risks is to introduce advanced static code analysis. By using code analysis
                    tools before every merge, vulnerabilities could be discovered in an early stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tests are another powerful tool to detect vulnerabilities. Developers could use test tools, such as
                    fuzzers, to detect whether the codes have unusual behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, this kind of vulnerability is introduced gradually. Accepting preventive patches could
                    reduce the risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to let developers understand this kind of attack so that they can be prepared
                    for this kind of attack.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, a standardized procedure enables better resistance to attacks.</p>

                <p>
                    Governments carry responsibility for a weighty task in combating the dominant menace of backdoors
                    with open-source software in order to strike root-minimize, recognizing that they need to lead by
                    paving way — enacting stringent legislative frameworks and regulations aimed at this ever-pervasive
                    threat. By taking the lead in this, governments can help keep digital ecosystems resilient and those
                    using them safe - no small thing for a global user-base. According to EUR-Lex, (2019) that Implement
                    policies and regulations requiring security assessments and audits for software developers and
                    vendors. In order to render open-source software more vulnerable to attacks, the government ought to
                    additionally encourage that use of secure coding practice and regular patches. For example, EUR-Lex,
                    (2019) stated that Governments can by their actions encourage software developers and sellers to
                    incorporate secure coding techniques into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and remain
                    vigilant through the application of security fixes, etc., via a variety of incentives and support
                    systems. To include grants or tax rebates — among other financial incentives — for businesses that
                    demonstrate commitment to cybersecurity excellence; Governments might also foster collaborations
                    between industry players, by launching cooperative and knowledge-sharing initiatives that would
                    create a cozy refuge for sharing what works (and celebrate those). Supporting such a culture can
                    assist the international software community to proactively act on any vulnerabilities and ensure
                    that open-source software remains a reliable and safe base for digital innovation, allowing
                    governments to carry out their foundational responsibility in securing cyberspace. EUR-Lex also
                    claims that the government could develop the standards in collaboration with industry players and
                    cybersecurity experts. In another words, If the state collaborated with these businesses by working
                    together, they may create strong standards for safe coding techniques by utilizing their combined
                    knowledge and expertise. By working together, we can make sure that software developers follow best
                    practices, which reduces vulnerabilities and strengthens the defenses of digital systems against
                    hostile attacks. Through the implementation of these standards, entities can cultivate a
                    security-conscious culture and considerably reduce the hazards linked to cyber events. Furthermore,
                    the government can spread awareness about the risks of cybersecurity such as the problem of
                    inserting backdoors into open source. For example, since we live in an internet-age society, the
                    government can support cyber security risks activities and run awareness campaigns, either online or
                    through education and training programs. The government ought to provide financial support to anyone
                    involved in these kinds of awareness campaigns and that is according also to EUR-Lex, (2019).
                    Rapidly Accredit Better Software: High standards for accrediting software, especially open source,
                    will strengthen cyber. These frameworks provide a systematic way to decide whether a product can be
                    exploited by vulnerabilities and prove if it complies with security principles. However, through the
                    creation of standards and laws which state what is required for certification we can ensure that
                    software products and systems are tested to a tough standard thereby reducing the risk from computer
                    hacking and data compromises. These frameworks can be used to accomplish full assessments across a
                    range of different items, promoting trust in the security of those goods both within businesses and
                    with customers. This assurance is important to help bolster the credibility of the cybersecurity
                    industry as a whole and promote the adoption of certified products. In addition, easy to build
                    certification frameworks also create an environment of accountability for developers and vendors by
                    enshrining best practices for security features room.registration deadlines These types of standards
                    encourage developers to build security into their solutions by rewarding them for making secure
                    development decisions which in turn leads to the establishment of more robust software products.
                    Ultimately, it will help us improve our overall cybersecurity posture, mitigate risks and develop
                    trust in the digital environment where we all live.

                    In order to reduce the present and future risks of backdoor inclusion in open-source software,
                    organizations must act now and take proactive measures to strengthen their security controls for all
                    digital assets. GitHub (2024) "Code Review" According to GitHub this is how that imaginary world of
                    Code Reviews can be practiced in real business world. how to spot seasoned coders who will guide you
                    along your journey (thanks to our "Best Practices for Code Review" on GitHub) It seems like we won't
                    touch anything beyond of the "open source way" to do code reviews during week 2 Technological
                    Implementation.This should be more than enough for the majority of software developers. It offers
                    specific, useful methods and tools for conducting better code reviews, which, at the least, result
                    in better code, better propagation, and occasionally even allow us to find problems early in the
                    development cycle. This guide outlines requirements for review shapes, timeliness, and etiquette in
                    an effort to provide developers and teams with the information and abilities they need to use
                    reviews of code as a productive instrument to ensure high software quality. While, the later book
                    "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" addresses some software creation methods in regard to the open source
                    concept in "The Open Source Developer's Guide", I outline some simple guidance applicable for using
                    open source . Transparent Development — transparency in everything we do — engaged inclusively and
                    transparently. This means anything from Open Source to plain "open" collaborative development in
                    crafting software. The Open Source Guide from GitHub offers suggestions and useful tips for how to
                    foster openness within open-source communities. In contrast, Eric S. Raymond's essay "The Cathedral
                    and the Bazaar" makes the entertaining comparison between the closed source-development model and
                    the open, distributed "bazaar" model, with the latter being the eventual development model for
                    projects that needed to scale past a certain point of complexity into open-source territory. Not
                    only that, according to GPGTools, (2024), that Determining the identity for each contributor helps
                    build the development community's accountability and assurance. For example, For accountability, and
                    to maintain trust within the development community, ensuring that a contributor is who they say they
                    are, is necessary. Like GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) Tools, gpgtools in Linux. org offer a feasible
                    proposal to securing peer identification by employing an electronic signature. There is also a
                    detailed guide on how to use GPG for secure development practices on its own "Using GPG for Secure
                    Package Management" by joeyh (GitHub developer). Those resources empower teams to establish robust
                    identity verification standards. Virtual Private Network (VPN) By implementing these practices
                    directly into your workflows, you increase the potential of unauthorized contributions, attacks and
                    pranks. Going forward, this will help keep the quality and security of all open source projects in
                    place. Ensuring transparency and integrity by confirming each identity that will contribute or use
                    the network. This way, the community can work together and make more innovations with a higher level
                    of guarantee. When businesses and organizations make identity verification a priority, they show an
                    unwavering allegiance to a safe, reputable development community. Furthermore, the business world
                    can Automated Testing &amp; analysis tools like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Code
                    analysis Tools allow developers to identify security weaknesses in their code, effectively. These
                    tools offer complete visibility into code quality and security to optimize development pipelines and
                    reinforce software reliability, and make sure that your users get resilient and secure applications.
                    It is true that the Static Application Security Testing (SAST) from OWASP, and the Automated Testing
                    and Analysis tools, as well as the Github Code Analysis Tools, always give a hand to the developers,
                    who wish to bulletproof their software for the security creatures. These resources enable developers
                    to perform holistic analysis of code quality and security as OWASP has a strong focus on security
                    specific vulnerabilities whereas GitHub has broad coverage of code quality aspects. Using these
                    tools as part of their workflows allows developers to follow better practices and produce more
                    reliable and secure software, finally achieving a higher quality for their users.
