                <h2>Choices for developers</h2>

                <p>
                    Developers have the most control over the software, thus their actions could greatly improve this
                    situation and reduce risks. Some choices including:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Develop and use advanced static code analysis
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increase test coverage
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accepting certain preventive patches
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Raising developers' risk awareness
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-1">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standardize code merge procedure, and require more developers to review before the merge
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html#ref-2">(Lins et al., 2024)</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    One way to mitigate the risks is to introduce advanced static code analysis. By using code analysis
                    tools before every merge, vulnerabilities could be discovered in an early stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tests are another powerful tool to detect vulnerabilities. Developers could use test tools, such as
                    fuzzers, to detect whether the codes have unusual behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, this kind of vulnerability is introduced gradually. Accepting preventive patches could
                    reduce the risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to let developers understand this kind of attack so that they can be prepared
                    for this kind of attack.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, a standardized procedure enables better resistance to attacks.</p>

                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Governments carry responsibility for a weighty task in combating the dominant menace of backdoors
                    with open-source software in order to strike root-minimize, recognizing that they need to lead by
                    paving way — enacting stringent legislative frameworks and regulations aimed at this ever-pervasive
                    threat. By taking the lead in this, governments can help keep digital ecosystems resilient and those
                    using them safe - no small thing for a global user-base. According to EUR-Lex, (2019) that Implement
                    policies and regulations requiring security assessments and audits for software developers and
                    vendors. In order to render open-source software more vulnerable to attacks, the government ought to
                    additionally encourage that use of secure coding practice and regular patches. For example, EUR-Lex,
                    (2019) stated that Governments can by their actions encourage software developers and sellers to
                    incorporate secure coding techniques into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and remain
                    vigilant through the application of security fixes, etc., via a variety of incentives and support
                    systems. To include grants or tax rebates — among other financial incentives — for businesses that
                    demonstrate commitment to cybersecurity excellence; Governments might also foster collaborations
                    between industry players, by launching cooperative and knowledge-sharing initiatives that would
                    create a cozy refuge for sharing what works (and celebrate those). Supporting such a culture can
                    assist the international software community to proactively act on any vulnerabilities and ensure
                    that open-source software remains a reliable and safe base for digital innovation, allowing
                    governments to carry out their foundational responsibility in securing cyberspace. EUR-Lex also
                    claims that the government could develop the standards in collaboration with industry players and
                    cybersecurity experts. In another words, If the state collaborated with these businesses by working
                    together, they may create strong standards for safe coding techniques by utilizing their combined
                    knowledge and expertise. By working together, we can make sure that software developers follow best
                    practices, which reduces vulnerabilities and strengthens the defenses of digital systems against
                    hostile attacks. Through the implementation of these standards, entities can cultivate a
                    security-conscious culture and considerably reduce the hazards linked to cyber events. Furthermore,
                    the government can spread awareness about the risks of cybersecurity such as the problem of
                    inserting backdoors into open source. For example, since we live in an internet-age society, the
                    government can support cyber security risks activities and run awareness campaigns, either online or
                    through education and training programs. The government ought to provide financial support to anyone
                    involved in these kinds of awareness campaigns and that is according also to EUR-Lex, (2019).
                    Rapidly Accredit Better Software: High standards for accrediting software, especially open source,
                    will strengthen cyber. These frameworks provide a systematic way to decide whether a product can be
                    exploited by vulnerabilities and prove if it complies with security principles. However, through the
                    creation of standards and laws which state what is required for certification we can ensure that
                    software products and systems are tested to a tough standard thereby reducing the risk from computer
                    hacking and data compromises. These frameworks can be used to accomplish full assessments across a
                    range of different items, promoting trust in the security of those goods both within businesses and
                    with customers. This assurance is important to help bolster the credibility of the cybersecurity
                    industry as a whole and promote the adoption of certified products. In addition, easy to build
                    certification frameworks also create an environment of accountability for developers and vendors by
                    enshrining best practices for security features room.registration deadlines These types of standards
                    encourage developers to build security into their solutions by rewarding them for making secure
                    development decisions which in turn leads to the establishment of more robust software products.
                    Ultimately, it will help us improve our overall cybersecurity posture, mitigate risks and develop
                    trust in the digital environment where we all live.
