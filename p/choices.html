                <h2>Choices for developers</h2>

                <p>
                    Developers have the most control over the software, thus their actions could greatly improve this
                    situation and reduce risks. Some choices including:

                        Raising developers' risk awareness
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html">(Wu &amp; Lu, 2020)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standardize code merge procedure, and require more developers to review before the merge
                        <a class="local-url" href="references.html">(Lins et al., 2024)</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    One way to mitigate the risks is to introduce advanced static code analysis. By using code analysis
                    tools before every merge, vulnerabilities could be discovered in an early stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tests are another powerful tool to detect vulnerabilities. Developers could use test tools, such as
                    fuzzers, to detect whether the codes have unusual behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, this kind of vulnerability is introduced gradually. Accepting preventive patches could
                    reduce the risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to let developers understand this kind of attack so that they can be prepared
                    for this kind of attack.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, a standardized procedure enables better resistance to attacks.</p>

                <p>
                    Governments are faced with a difficult task in battling the growing threat of backdoors by using
                    open-source software to strike a root-minimize strategy. They understand that they must set the
                    example by passing strict laws and regulations that target this persistent threat. By taking the
                    lead in this, governments can help keep digital ecosystems resilient and those using them safe - no
                    small thing for a global user-base. According to EUR-Lex, (2019) that Implement policies and
                    regulations requiring security assessments and audits for software developers and vendors; in order
                    to render open-source software more vulnerable to attacks, the government ought to additionally
                    encourage that use of secure coding practice and regular patches. For example, EUR-Lex, (2019)
                    stated that Governments can by their actions encourage software developers and sellers to
                    incorporate secure coding techniques into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and remain
                    vigilant through the application of security fixes, etc., via a variety of incentives and support
                    systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EUR-Lex also claims that the government could develop the standards in collaboration with industry
                    players and cybersecurity experts. In another words, If the state collaborated with these businesses
                    by working together, they may create strong standards for safe coding techniques by utilizing their
                    combined knowledge and expertise. By working together, we can make sure that software developers
                    follow best practices, which reduces vulnerabilities and strengthens the defenses of digital systems
                    against hostile attacks. Through the implementation of these standards, entities can cultivate a
                    security-conscious culture and considerably reduce the hazards linked to cyber events. Furthermore,
                    the government can spread awareness about the risks of cybersecurity such as the problem of
                    inserting backdoors into open source. For example, since we live in an internet-age society, the
                    government can support cyber security risks activities and run awareness campaigns, either online or
                    through education and training programs. These frameworks provide a systematic way to decide whether
                    a product can be exploited by vulnerabilities and prove if it complies with security principles.
                    However, through the creation of standards and laws which state what is required for certification
                    we can ensure that software products and systems are tested to a tough standard thereby reducing the
                    risk from computer hacking and data compromises. These frameworks can be used to accomplish full
                    assessments across a range of different items, promoting trust in the security of those goods both
                    within businesses and with customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, easy to build certification frameworks also create an environment of accountability for
                    developers and vendors by ensuring best practices for security features. Ultimately, it will help us
                    improve our overall cybersecurity posture, mitigate risks and develop trust in the digital
                    environment where we all live.

                    digital assets. GitHub (2024) "Code Review" According to GitHub this is how that imaginary world of
                    Code Reviews can be practiced in a real business world. how to spot seasoned coders who will guide
                    you along your journey (thanks to our "Best Practices for Code Review" on GitHub). It offers
                    specific, useful methods and tools for conducting better code reviews, which, at the least, result
                    in better code, better propagation, and occasionally even allow us to find problems early in the
                    development cycle. This guide outlines requirements for review shapes, timeliness, and etiquette in
                    an effort to provide developers and teams with the information and abilities they need to use
                    reviews of code as a productive instrument to ensure high software quality. Transparent Development
                    is one way to ensure good coding practice. This means anything from Open Source to plain "open"
                    collaborative development in crafting software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Open Source Guide from GitHub offers suggestions and useful tips for how to foster openness
                    within open-source communities. In contrast, Eric S. Raymond's essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
                    makes the entertaining comparison between the closed source-development model and the open,
                    distributed "bazaar" model, with the latter being the eventual development model for projects that
                    needed to scale past a certain point of complexity into open-source territory. Not only that,
                    according to GPGTools, (2024), that Determining the identity for each contributor helps build the
                    development community's accountability and assurance. For example, For accountability, and to
                    maintain trust within the development community, ensuring that a contributor is who they say they
                    are, is necessary. Like GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) Tools, gpgtools in Linux. org offer a feasible
                    proposal to securing peer identification by employing an electronic signature. There is also a
                    detailed guide on how to use GPG for secure development practices on its own "Using GPG for Secure
                    Package Management" by joeyh (GitHub developer). Those resources empower teams to establish robust
                    identity verification standards. Virtual Private Network (VPN) By implementing these practices
                    directly into your workflows, you increase the potential of unauthorized contributions, attacks and
                    pranks. Going forward, this will help keep the quality and security of all open source projects in
                    place. Ensuring transparency and integrity by confirming each identity that will contribute or use
                    the network. This way, the community can work together and make more innovations with a higher level
                    of guarantee. When businesses and organisations make identity verification a priority, they show an
                    unwavering allegiance to a safe, reputable development community.

                    Furthermore, the business world can Automated Testing &amp; analysis tools like Static Application
                    Security Testing (SAST) and Code analysis Tools allow developers to identify security weaknesses in
                    their code, effectively. These tools offer complete visibility into code quality and security to
                    optimize development pipelines and reinforce software reliability, and make sure that your users get
                    resilient and secure applications. It is true that the Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
                    from OWASP, and the Automated Testing and Analysis tools, as well as the Github Code Analysis Tools,
                    always give a hand to the developers, who wish to bulletproof their software for the security
                    creatures. These resources enable developers to perform holistic analysis of code quality and
                    security as OWASP has a strong focus on security specific vulnerabilities whereas GitHub has broad
                    coverage of code quality aspects. Using these tools as part of their workflows allows developers to
                    follow better practices and produce more reliable and secure software, finally achieving a higher

                <h2>Choices for individuals</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to battling backdoors into open-source software, individuals may be crucial players.
                    People who follow coding standards and best practices can contribute to the introduction of
                    backdoors into open source. Taking a thorough look at your code and regularly reviewing it is
                    another effective method for avoiding backdoors. It is important to thoroughly evaluate and
                    regularly update any third-party libraries, frameworks, or plugins that you incorporate into your
                    code. This ensures that you are using reliable and high-quality resources. It's important to
                    thoroughly review your code and remove any lines, functions, or variables that may pose a security
                    risk. Utilizing code review tools and peer reviews can be beneficial in facilitating this process.
                    In another wors, being incessantly vigilant about your code and activities is one of the essential
                    ways to avoid backdoors. You need to sit there watching your code repository to see if things
                    change, if new pushes have been done, if something got merged. Go one step further whenever anyone
                    assisting you in your codebase requires authorisation. Follow your system and application logs,
                    traffic, as well as the performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be Alert: Keep an eye out for warning signs of strange activity as well as questionable login
                    attempts. Staying conscious and alert helps you see the signs and symptoms earlier on and react
                    sooner to potential threats. This ensures that you can never avoid these tasks, another way of
                    making it easier is to set up monitoring and deep linking with CloudWatch. In addition, LinkedIn,
                    (2024), also claims that thoroughly testing your code and environment will help you avoid backdoors.
                    To be sure your code has no hidden or unexpected features and functions as expected, you should run
                    unit, integration, and functional tests. To be certain your code doesn't perform differently or
                    reveal any backdoors, you should additionally test it in staging, production, and users' devices.
                    Automation and simplification of this procedure are possible using testing frameworks and tools.
                    Reacting quickly to reports of backdoors is one way to prevent them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should you learn or believe that a backdoor has penetrated your code, you should promptly isolate,
                    remove, and fix the backdoor and alert the pertinent authorities, stakeholders, and users. To stop
                    future occurrences of this kind, you should also investigate the backdoor's origin, effects, and
                    breath and put preventative and remedial steps in place. Adopting secure coding practices will help
                    you to prevent backdoors in your application. Enforcing strong encryption, authentication, and
                    validation mechanisms are the critical factors in security posture of your data/system preventing
                    unauthorised access to the system. Employ dynamic, properly managed credentials rather than
                    hard-coded passwords or keys. As it is always essential to maintain your input/output and cache in
                    order to avoid injection initiatives on your system data. These proactive strategies will minimize
                    the probability of successful backdoors.
