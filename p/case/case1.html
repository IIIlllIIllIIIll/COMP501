            <h2>Linux incident</h2>
            <p>
                In 2020, researchers at the University of Minnesota (UMN) submitted multiple "Hypocrite Commits" to the
                Linux Kernel for their research purpose without prior consent from the Linux community. The term
                "Hypocrite Commits" refers to codes that contain known security issues deliberately implemented by
                developers. After their research, they published the paper "On the Feasibility of Stealthily Introducing
                Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Software via Hypocrite Commits" in November 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                In late 2020, the Linux community noticed this paper, and UMN published clarifications related to the
                paper. However, in April 2021, people in the UMN submitted poor-quality patches to the Linux Kernel, and
                the community started worrying about whether they started new research that may harm the Linux Kernel.
                So, the Linux community started banning patches from UMN by default on the 20th of April 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few days after that, the Linux community and UNM had multiple conversations and settled it down, and
                the paper withdrew from public publication.
