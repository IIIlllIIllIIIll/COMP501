            <h2>
                The intentional inclusion of backdoors in server-sider open-source software and the associated risks.
            </h2>

            <p>
                Backdoors are a method of getting around normal security measures through authorised or unauthorised
                access. They can be used to gain high level access. It is a purposeful flaw introduced into a system
                that is unknown to the end user but known to the system's implementer and serves to undermine the
                system's perceived security <a class="local-url" href="references.html">(Thomas, 2018)</a> The topic we
                have chosen focuses on developers intentionally inserting these backdoors for malicious intent.
            </p>
            <p>
                These backdoors have important implications for society. One of them is that they are breaking society's
                high level of trust in developers. The deliberate insertion of backdoors erodes confidence in
                open-source software development and maintenance organisations as well as in technology. Users can start
                to avoid using open-source software out of concern that it has harmful code or hidden weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Backdoors are also a huge security risk and enable society to major data leaks. They can jeopardise
                people's privacy by granting unauthorised access to private information that is transferred or stored by
                the impacted program. This compromises people's right to privacy and may result in legal and regulatory
                infractions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Backdoor-caused security breaches can result in severe financial consequences for enterprises, including
                lost revenue, cleanup expenses, and harm to the reputation of a brand. This may stifle economic growth
                and impede technological innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deliberate insertion of backdoors into server-side open-source software presents a variety of
                hazards and difficulties for society, from cybersecurity concerns to a decline in public confidence in
                institutions and technology. To improve openness, accountability, and security in software development
                and deployment, stakeholders—including developers, legislators, regulators, and the larger IT
                community—must work together to address these issues.
