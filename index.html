        <h1>CTiS: Impact of Technology Site</h1>

        <p>
            This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take this as a set of files and as a
            starting point and adapt it to your preference. It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be
            flash, but now has an image, [of a paper we wrote a while back on CSED4G (Computing Education for the Social
            Good)]
        </p>
        <p>
            The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can
            be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip; It has some
            default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure. The <em>Process Support </em>Links
            provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project.
